You: say I'm writing an constructor and I want to set one of the fields to a parameter passed to the constructor (say an int called count).
What's the difference between saying
countField = count;
and 
this.countField = count;
Deric Pang: No difference, unless the parameter is defined as the same name
Deric Pang: this.countField = countField, for example
Deric Pang: Where countField is the name of your parameter
Deric Pang: If your parameter is named countField and you try to do countField = countField...obviously that's gonna cause problems
You: I see

Deric Pang: is pretty dope
You: K
Deric Pang: the beef rap song
You: Haha oh yeah
You: The album is great
Deric Pang: ayyyyy
You: 20xx cpus are no joke
Deric Pang: LOL
Deric Pang: they're basically impossible man
Deric Pang: fox just drill shines you to death
Deric Pang: LMAO
Deric Pang: so
Deric Pang: I shouldn't actually talk
Deric Pang: but
Deric Pang: wait
Deric Pang: where'd you go
Deric Pang: oh
Deric Pang: shit
Deric Pang: wrong chat
Deric Pang: FUCK
You: What shouldn't you talk about Deric?
You: ; )
You: Netplay me beotch
You: wait ok
Deric Pang: What
You: I implemented a binary tree without using the x = change(x) format
You: but it looks like it works
Deric Pang: Huh? xD
Deric Pang: What's X = change(X)?
You: like if you're inserting a node in a tree, you'd write overallRoot = insert(node, overallRoot) instead of insert(node, overallRoot)
You: or something
Deric Pang: Oh
Deric Pang: Uhhhh
Deric Pang: If you elaborate I might be able to help
Deric Pang: Like, are you talking about the insert method of a binary search tree?
You: yeah
You: like in this example
You: http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring07/V22.0102-002/BinarySearchTree.java
Deric Pang: oh ic
Deric Pang: how did you do it differently?
You: like
You: not doing that
Deric Pang: oh
Deric Pang: if you wanna send me your code I can take a look at it
Deric Pang: also, writing test cases for yourself might be good
Deric Pang: like, in a main method
Deric Pang: just try inserting nodes
Deric Pang: and see if the tree turns out the way you expect it to
You: yeah I did that a bit
You: I got the expected output
Deric Pang: h
Deric Pang: oh
Deric Pang: what you did shouldn't be that bad then :o
You: huh
You: I didn't do it
You: cause I was dumb
You: and then it worked
You: and I don't know why
Deric Pang: LOLOL
Deric Pang: just show me the insert method
You: public void insert(String keyword, FileData fd){
      Record recordToAdd = new Record(fd.id, fd.title, fd.author, null);
      // TODO Write a recursive insertion that adds recordToAdd 
      // to the list of records for the node associated with keyword.
      // If there is no node, this code should add the node.
      if (this.contains(keyword)) {
         Node n = find(keyword);
         n.update(recordToAdd);
      } else {
         if (overallRoot == null) {
            Node inserted = new Node(keyword);
            overallRoot = inserted;  
            inserted.update(recordToAdd);       
         } else {
            insertHelper(keyword, overallRoot, recordToAdd);
         }
      }
   }
	
   public void insertHelper(String keyword, Node root, Record recordToAdd) {
      if (keyword.compareTo(root.keyword) < 0) {
         if (root.l == null) {
            Node inserted = new Node(keyword);
            root.l = inserted;
            inserted.update(recordToAdd); 
         } else {
            insertHelper(keyword, root.l, recordToAdd);
         }
      } else {
         if (root.r == null) {
            Node inserted = new Node(keyword);
            root.r = inserted;
            inserted.update(recordToAdd);
         } else {
            insertHelper(keyword, root.r, recordToAdd);
         }
      }
   }
You: basically each node holds a keyword and a list of things associated with that keyword
Deric Pang: so
Deric Pang: fd
Deric Pang: is the list of things associated with it?
Deric Pang: and your binary tree is sorted alphabetically by keyword?
You: yea
Deric Pang: when you do
Deric Pang: this.contains(keyword)
Deric Pang: you have a contains method
You: yeah don't worry about fd
Deric Pang: that checks if your tree contains it?
You: that was written for us
Deric Pang: as was find?
You: no we had to write find
Deric Pang: oh okay
Deric Pang: no worries
Deric Pang: I understand it now
You: wait no we had to write contains as well
Deric Pang: oh
Deric Pang: so your way
Deric Pang: is just less elegant
You: i meant the fd class was written for us
Deric Pang: but it's the same shit
You: good
Deric Pang: so
You: I remember reges saying it wouldn't work last quarter
Deric Pang: the general idea
Deric Pang: is
Deric Pang: recurse correctly to left and right
Deric Pang: until you hit null
Deric Pang: then shove the new node in
Deric Pang: if you look at NYU's code
Deric Pang: and your code
Deric Pang: they're both doing exactly that
Deric Pang: recurse until you find the null left/right
Deric Pang: and then make it
You: yeah
You: Reges you lied to me
You: ok thanks
Deric Pang: hmmm
Deric Pang: I'm not sure why he would say that but
Deric Pang: do they grade on style?
Deric Pang: cuz the NYU one is certainly better style
You: Yeah
You: Wait the class I'm doing now?
Deric Pang: yeah
You: Not nearly as much as 143
Deric Pang: oh okay cool
You: you want to take the link downtown with me

You: Your
Deric Pang: sorta
Deric Pang: but like
Deric Pang: DOES IT REALLY MATTER IN THE END
You: I guess the example I always go back to whenever I think about this stuff
You: Is Janos starker
You: My old cello teacher's teacher
You: I've met so many other people that either took from him or learned from one of his students
You: He did so much for the instrument and the cello playing world
You: And at the end of his life he said he wanted to be remembered as a teacher, and not a performer or prize winner
You: So I guess he's one of the people I can think of who really made an impact
Deric Pang: oh shit
Deric Pang: janos?!
Deric Pang: that's sick
You: Yeah
You: I don't know
You: Ok

Deric Pang: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100014857065653
You: not worth
Deric Pang: HAHA
Deric Pang: but honestly I'm surprised that it works on people...
You: yeah
You: there's sum thirsty mfers out there
Deric Pang: Hajun g<3
You: y
Deric Pang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAQe8e9juJs
Deric Pang: dude so
Deric Pang: this is when I realized I shouldn't go to conservatory
Deric Pang: my violin teacher showed me this in junior year
You: o cry
You: I wonder what that kid is up to now
Deric Pang: she's had an illustrious career as a professional violinist for many years :'(
You: ah
You: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBXZWB_dNsw
Deric Pang: he's a hack
Deric Pang: I've seen that shit before
Deric Pang: my dick dreams in code too
You: lel
Deric Pang: wait dude
Deric Pang: there's another one
Deric Pang: of just like a mildly intelligent kid
Deric Pang: but his ego is so fucking bloated that he thinks he's the next einstein or something
Deric Pang: oh this is cool though
Deric Pang: do you know terrence tao
Deric Pang: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y30VF3cSIYQ&t=453s
You: that name sounds familiar
Deric Pang: UCLA prof, won the fields medal
Deric Pang: anyways that video is an interesting
Deric Pang: about a problem during the math olympiad
You: yeah
You: watching it
You: dang gotta watch the next part
Deric Pang: heuheueheuheue
You: how would you even design a problem like this
Deric Pang: yeah dude it's nuts right
You: yea
Deric Pang: e = mc^2
Deric Pang: dude have you seem the proof
Deric Pang: that
Deric Pang: 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . = -1/12
You: haha yeah
You: shit's fucked up
Deric Pang: shook 2 da core
You: but you have to assume that 1 - 1 + 1 ... = 1/2
You: or something like that
You: seems like a spurious assumption to me
Deric Pang: consider s = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 . . .
Deric Pang: then -s = -1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1
Deric Pang: or rather
Deric Pang: consider adding them offset by 1
Deric Pang: so s + s
Deric Pang: can be written as
Deric Pang: 1 + ( -1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1)
Deric Pang: s + s = 1
Deric Pang: ;)
You: hmm
You: questionable at the very least
Deric Pang: it's correct!
You: because it's infinite....
You: so can we really write it like that
You: grouping the terms together
Deric Pang: yerrrp
Deric Pang: because we know it goes on forever
You: but you could group the terms differently and get a different answer
You: so
You: I dunno
You: (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) ...
You: s + s = 0
Deric Pang: ah, yes
Deric Pang: I think the incorrect part of that reasoning is that infinity doesn't necessarily provide you with an even or odd number of terms in s
You: yeah
You: Exactly
You: Let's leave it at questionable
Deric Pang: LOLOL
Deric Pang: the creepy part is that
Deric Pang: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 .. = -1/12
Deric Pang: is used in physics
Deric Pang: so
Deric Pang: *shrug*
You: I don't know if you've been in the physics building, they're all just on blow
You: can't trust em
Deric Pang: that's so true
You: oh well
You: all the chemes are distilling ethanol in school's dist collumn
Deric Pang: wuz a dist collumn
You: distillation column
You: it's how you purity and separate stuff
You: like alcohol
Deric Pang: OH SHIT SON
Deric Pang: straight to the dome
Deric Pang: let's do it sometime
You: if you're suggested we poison ourselves by trying to drink purified rubbing alcohol
You: im in
Deric Pang: till death do us part
Deric Pang: or something right
You: yea
You: oh yeah pro tip
You: don't drink alcohol above like 96%
Deric Pang: o y
You: it's beyond how far alcohol can be distilled from an ethanol/water solution, so it had to be created from reaction
You: and most likely contains benzene which will poison the shit out of u
Deric Pang: oh fuk
Deric Pang: I will keep that shit in mind
Deric Pang: straight to the dome though
Deric Pang: also, I have a dream
Deric Pang: that hajung will come party with us some day

Deric Pang: yeah he definitely thought I was retarded
Deric Pang: you have cpus, stocks, and data sources
Deric Pang: each stock needs to query from of data sources
Deric Pang: different stocks can query from overlapping set of data structures
Deric Pang: schedule the cpus to work on the stocks so that you minimize the amount of work of querying data soures
You: sounds hard
Deric Pang: yah dude
Deric Pang: =_=
You: eh you don't need em
Deric Pang: riiiipppp dude
You: 🍸
You: I need halp
You: I installed a package with pip
You: but when I try to import it I get ImportError: No module named ...
Deric Pang: interesting
You: it seems 3 simple 5 fail
Deric Pang: which module
You: something for my controls class
You: it's called
You: control
Deric Pang: you installed it using "pip install control"
Deric Pang: ?
You: yeah
You: well I used sudo
Deric Pang: you're on macosx right
Deric Pang: how'd you install pip for the first tie
Deric Pang: time
You: uh
You: don't remember haha
Deric Pang: was it somethign like sudo easy_install pip
Deric Pang: what do you get when you type `which python`
Deric Pang: `which pip`
Deric Pang: and `python -version
Deric Pang: oh
Deric Pang: without the backquotes
You: /usr/local/bin/pip
Deric Pang: which python gives you?
Deric Pang: wait what
Deric Pang: local bin
Deric Pang: wtffffff
Deric Pang: are you using homebrew
You: uhhhhhh
You: maybe
You: /usr/bin/python
Deric Pang: interesting that's not good
Deric Pang: uhhhhh
Deric Pang: you know what
Deric Pang: send me your code
You: haha ok
Deric Pang: what does python -version give you
Deric Pang: sorry, python --version
Deric Pang: two dashes
You: 2.7.10
You: huh I just tried pip list and it's definitely not listing everything I've ever installed
You: maybe I changed where the packages live at some point
Deric Pang: yeah dude like
Deric Pang: this is why I use python virtualenv
Deric Pang: is control there at least?
You: control is there
Deric Pang: so it ran for me
Deric Pang: try
Deric Pang: try uninstalling control
Deric Pang: and reinstalling it
You: yessir
You: still no work
You: wait
You: I tried
You: echo $PYTHONPATH
You: and it didn't print anything
You: is that bad
Deric Pang: uhhh
You: I'm pretty sure I fucked something up when I was trying to install the sdk for the allen institute
You: sigh
Deric Pang: lol
Deric Pang: try doing this
Deric Pang: without backticks
Deric Pang: `python -c "import control"`
Deric Pang: `echo $?`
Deric Pang: what does that output
You: `the first statement gives the same importerror
You: second statement gives 1
You: ???
Deric Pang: okay
Deric Pang: it's definitely not picking it up then
Deric Pang: let's see
Deric Pang: type pip --version
You: I feel like a virtual env would be a lot easier
You: pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
Deric Pang: you could definitely try setting that up
Deric Pang: okay try
Deric Pang: doing
Deric Pang: export $PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Deric Pang: then running that python -c shit again
You: right ok
You: -bash: export: `=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages': not a valid identifier
Deric Pang: uhhhh
Deric Pang: oh
Deric Pang: put the shit in quoets
Deric Pang: "/usr/fjdsklfjdsklfdsjf"
Deric Pang: shit
You: oh there's no $
Deric Pang: not dollar sign
Deric Pang: yeah
You: it worked
Deric Pang: LOL
Deric Pang: wait
Deric Pang: your python -c shit
Deric Pang: works?
You: I can just run the script now
Deric Pang: lmfao
You: sick
Deric Pang: computers fucking suck
You: huh
You: why did PYTHONPATH not have a value before?
Deric Pang: fuck if i know dude
Deric Pang: welcome to my life
Deric Pang: LOLOL
Deric Pang: if you want this to never happen again
You: good
Deric Pang: go to your home directory
Deric Pang: vim into a file called .bash_profile
Deric Pang: put the line export PYTHONPATH='JFDSLFJDSLKFJSDLKFSD"
Deric Pang: then save it
Deric Pang: and never worry about it again
Deric Pang: until you have to use a different verison of python
Deric Pang: or pip
Deric Pang: or a package
Deric Pang: hahahahahhahahahhahahahahhaa
You: kill me
Deric Pang: yah dude
Deric Pang: it blows
You: permission denied when editing .bash_profile
You: w t f
Deric Pang: ...
Deric Pang: what the
Deric Pang: you're in your home directory?!??!??!
Deric Pang: bruh something's fucked and idk what it is HAHA
You: I had to use sudo
You: to edit it
Deric Pang: you messed up permissions at some point
Deric Pang: that really shouldn't happen
You: hmmmmmmmmmm
You: sounds likely
You: is this what being a software developer is like?
You: o jk I typed the file name wrong
Deric Pang: that right htere
Deric Pang: is exactly what being a software developer is like
You: frowny face
You: wait ok one more question
You: if I use a virtual environment
You: does it actually put the contents of every module and dependency in my project folder?
You: like am I going to have 20 versions of numpy floating around because it's a dependency for a lot of things?
Deric Pang: yes
Deric Pang: but you'd rather have that
Deric Pang: than have every project share dependencies
Deric Pang: trust me
Deric Pang: ;)
Deric Pang: pro tip
Deric Pang: use
Deric Pang: pyenv virtualenvs
Deric Pang: install them with homebrew
Deric Pang: http://brew.sh/
Deric Pang: brew install pyenv
Deric Pang: brew install pyenv-virtualenv
Deric Pang: quite terminal and open it again
Deric Pang: pyenv install 2.7.13
Deric Pang: pyenv virtualenv 2.7.13 <insert name of env here>
Deric Pang: then to use your env
Deric Pang: pyenv activate <insert name of env here>
Deric Pang: then you can use "python" and "pip" and everything will be in that env
Deric Pang: when you're done working in that env
Deric Pang: pyenv deactivate
You: ok let me try that
You: i tried
You: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
Deric Pang: easier to also use pyenv
Deric Pang: since you can adjust python versions too
Deric Pang: it's like total control
Deric Pang: gives me a boner everytime
Deric Pang: if you blow your load when it works I won't blame you
Deric Pang: but if you have to `sudo brew`
Deric Pang: Something's messed up HAHA
You: some dark spirit has taken my laptop
You: ugh ok I think I got it
Deric Pang: what was wrong? :o
You: added somthing to bash profile
You: seems to work...
You: and then I got another error
You: and then added something to some file in matplotlib
You: I think it's working
Deric Pang: uhhhhhhhhhh
Deric Pang: LOLOL

You: bruh it tilts me when chamber groups play music that's too hard for them
You: like not technically hard

You: like when CMC groups play late beethoven
You: like it's in tune
You: but they're shitting on the music
You: so tilted
Deric Pang: I feel like we're all pretty garbage
Deric Pang: so even the things that we can "play" sound awful
Deric Pang: so why not just yolo it
You: I guess
You: actually it's very specifically late beethoven quartets
Deric Pang: LOL
You: that gets me
Deric Pang: I just hate beethoen
Deric Pang: okay well
Deric Pang: his quartets
Deric Pang: I think they're boring
You: lel
Deric Pang: but I feel
Deric Pang: apparently the 15th quartet was debuted by fresh college grads though
You: they were probably pretty good
Deric Pang: yeah it's just strange cuz he usually had the beethoven quartet debut his stuff
You: huh
You: I just think that if you can't do some small amount of justice to the music you shouldn't play it
Deric Pang: oh I wasn't talking about that
Deric Pang: I was just stating a fact
You: yeah I know
You: I'm just in a cycle of tilting myself
Deric Pang: I think it's fair to get mad
